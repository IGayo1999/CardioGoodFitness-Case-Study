## Defining the Question <a id="defining_the_question"></a>

Identify the key factors that decide which product customers purchase from CardioGoodFitness over the last 3 months and any actions that can be taken to improve product sales

## Collecting Data <a id="collecting-data"></a>

In order to answer this question I had to take a look at the CardioGoodFitness dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurav9786/cardiogoodfitness/data).

## Cleaning the Data <a id="cleaning-data"></a>

After collecting the data, I tried to perform cleaning and pre-processing tasks to make the data fit for analysis purposes. Fortunately, as the data was already cleaned of erroneous and null values, I did not need to perform any more data cleaning and pre-processing tasks.

## Analysing the Data <a id="analysing-data"></a>

After (attempting to) clean and pre-process the data, I used PowerBI to calculate, summarise and analyse the data to make comparisons and spot patterns and trends in the data.

Through this, I tried to check the link between product sales and different factors including: gender, marital status, age, income, (self-rated) fitness rating of the customers, average expected miles walked/ran and finally average planned usage amounts.

## Visualising and sharing my findings <a id="visualising-data"></a>

Finally, I decided to use PowerBI to visualise and share my findings from the data.

## Insights Gained <a id="insights-gained"></a>

CardioGoodFitness customers were more likely to be male than female, more likely to be partnered than single and most likely to be between the ages of 18-25.

TM195 was the most popular product regardless of the age group – Maybe it was viewed to be the most reliable product between all three offerings?

TM498 was the middle child in terms of sales yet statistics of customers did not seem to differ too much from TM195.

TM798 seemed to be preferred by more fit and higher income customers

<span><div style="text-align: right">[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</div></span>

## Actions to be taken <a id="actions-to-be-taken"></a>

Increase sales of products to females – perhaps find a way to promote the products to females more?

Increase sales of products to people not in relationships – perhaps through marketing or targeted ads.

Increase sales of TM498 by trying to market it towards a different base than TM195 as it seemed to attract the same customer base as TM195.

Increase sales of TM798 to less fit and lower income users as it seemed to be marketed as a premium product only suited to more fit users – Maybe through sales/promotions and targeted marketing?
